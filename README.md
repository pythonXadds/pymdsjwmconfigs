# pymd's 'Joe's window manager configs'


>I'm still only experenting at the moment with Jwm, it's very much a work in progress, I will continue to update it here. Though, I wouldn't think it quite ready for anyone to use as their main config. 

I've added: 

* **dmenu** *one can now use the key bindings, Alt+D which will spawn the menu*
* **Keybindings** added. 
* **xdgmenmaker** added. *one can now add menu items, and they will automatically be added to the menu and 
will have an Icon added*
* *follow this link to install xdgmenmaker the easy way: <https://notabug.org/adnan360/jwm-config> 


**to-do**
>make a wifi taskbar shortcut
